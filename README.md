# Next.js node-fetch Error in getServerSideProps() in Production

This repository demonstrates a common error when using `node-fetch` within the `getServerSideProps` function in Next.js applications.  The issue arises because `node-fetch` is not automatically available in the serverless environment used by platforms like Vercel.

## Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to fetch data using `node-fetch` inside `getServerSideProps`. While this works in development, it causes an error in production because the serverless function environment doesn't include `node-fetch` by default.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file corrects this by using the built-in `fetch` API (available in Node.js 18+)  removing unnecessary `node-fetch` import.  This ensures the application works correctly in both development and production environments.
